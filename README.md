### Sharding

**Definition**:
- A database architecture pattern related to horizontal partitioning — splitting a dataset into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards.

**Benefits**:
- **Scalability**: Allows handling of large datasets.
- **Performance**: Improves query performance by distributing the load.

**Diagram**:

          Database
     +-------------------+
     |       Shard 1     |
     +-------------------+
     |       Shard 2     |
     +-------------------+
     |       Shard 3     |
     +-------------------+
```
- 🔄 **Sharding**: Divides data into parts for better management.
